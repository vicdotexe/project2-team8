## Description

Renegade art is a website where viewers of art can comment on peices, follow artist and like their art. For artist it is a place where art can be uploaded and displayed. The artist has an option to set keywords to their artwork for easy search by viewers, they can describe their art which is displayed as well. If they wish the art can be taken down or edited by the artist only, who must log in to edit their work and can only edit their own work aside from leaving comments and likes.
This project is another art website that can be used as an alternative to other bigger sites where artist would have more competition for views. We all learned through this project that even in back end developement that javascript in an invaluable tool and a majority of our site is made up of JavaScript. It really is the connective tissue and muscle that makes creates functions and executes them. Tailwind was used for most of the CSS, it was fun to work with and an easy alternative to Bootstrap.
